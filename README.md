In this repository I show my realizations of "Game of life" and "Simple Math Plotter".

Game of life:
- Compile .c file and redirect initial state from "initial_states/" folder:
-- e.g.: a.out < initial_states/state4_mid.txt
- Or you can choose size of matrix in menu and then insert it with zeroes and ones.

Simple Math Plotter:
- Compile it with Makefile.
- Run and type some math operation (e.g. sin(x)). It should output corresponding graph.
- Y-axes targeted down.
- Programm works, but it is buggy. Sometimes catches segmentation fault. Be careful
